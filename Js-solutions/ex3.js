You've bought a Bitcoin and now it's on the rise!!!

Create a program that:
1) Reads the value of the bitcoin at the time of purchase
2) Reads the percentage of increase (or decrease)
3) Prints the total value of your bitcoin
4) Prints the increase or decrease value

* Example: bitcoin_value = 10000, bitcoin_increase = 10
* Output: total_bitcoin_value = 11000, bitcoin_increase_value = 1000


*/

let bitcoin = 200000;
let porcentagem = 0.3; // 30% 60MIL
let aumento =(bitcoin*porcentagem);
let total =(bitcoin+aumento);
console.log(total)
