 * In a company the monthly salary of an employee is calculated by: the minimum wage 400$ per month, plus 20$ multiplied by the number of years employed, plus 30$ for each child they have.

Create a program that:
1) Reads the number of years employed
2) Reads the number of children the employee has
3) Prints the total amount of salary the employee makes

* Output: "The total amount is 560$. 400$ minimum wage + 100$ for 5 years experience + 60$ for 2 kids"
