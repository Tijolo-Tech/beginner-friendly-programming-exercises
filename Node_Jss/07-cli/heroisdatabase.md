 ## Herois Database

This project is a simple Node.js application that demonstrates how to perform basic CRUD operations on a database of superheroes. The application uses the `assert` module for unit testing and the `database.js` module for interacting with the database.

### Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/herois-database.git
cd herois-database
npm install
```

### Running the Tests

To run the tests, simply run the following command:

```
npm test
```

The tests will verify that the `cadastrar` and `listar` functions are working correctly.

### Code Explanation

The `database.js` module exports two functions: `cadastrar` and `listar`. The `cadastrar` function takes a superhero object as an argument and adds it to the database. The `listar` function takes an ID as an argument and returns the superhero object with that ID.

The `Suite de Manipulação de Herois` test suite contains one test case: `deve cadastrar um heroi, usando arquivos`. This test case verifies that the `cadastrar` function is working correctly by adding a superhero object to the database and then verifying that the object can be retrieved using the `listar` function.

The test case uses the `deepEqual` function from the `assert` module to compare the expected and actual results. The `deepEqual` function compares two objects and verifies that they have the same properties and values.

### Conclusion

This project provides a simple example of how to perform basic CRUD operations on a database of superheroes. The code is well-documented and easy to understand, making it a great resource for junior developers who are learning how to work with databases.
