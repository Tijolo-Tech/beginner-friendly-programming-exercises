# Programming exercises for beginners
#
[These exercises are focused on absolute beginners.](exercises.md)
The purpose of [these exercises](exercises.md) is to help you develop algorithmic problem solving skills from an early stage in your programming journey.

## How to do the exercises

* [Click here to find the exercises](exercises.md)
* Attempt the challenges in Javascript
* If you get stuck it's ok to see the [solution](solutions.md), but it is highly recommended to attept the problems yourself first.
* Try to not use the programming language MAGIC
* After you done with the exercise try to attempt it another language you are learning, or if possible make a general purpose code for that problem. Ex) ratrher than explicitly adding 5 + 3 for the specific problem: the general solution can be: return a + b, where a and b satisfy the addition problem but for ALL numbers.
